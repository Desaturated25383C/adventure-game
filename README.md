# adventure-game
This is a project done for Udacity's Nanodegree: Introduction to programming. 
## The Game
The game is originally titled: The Escape Room, then changed to Adventure-game to match the title of the project at Udacity. 
After some modifications, to access the game, only the file named: adventure_game.py is needed. 
The other files were used for brainstorming.
### Gameplay
The player is trapped inside of a mysterious house. The only thing the player had to do is to read the story and make choice accordingly in order to escape. There are in total 4 different endings, but only 1 happy ending. The choice the player make has impact on the enidng of the game.
